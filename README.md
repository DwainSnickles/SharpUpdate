On your server add [update] folder

add [testApp1.exe] and [updateTest.xml] file in folder

[updateTest.xml] sample: included in code.

Made several changes from video and video source code is long gone.

Change code http://sourcecodedepot.com to your site name.

Still need to update webclient to show status and load download form.

Theory I used webclient to download apptest1.exe to bin folder the app closes the command windows does the rest moves rewrites etc.
